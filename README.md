### APIs

- **Jumia**: If you're targeting the African market, especially with a mix of classifieds and real estate, Jumia could be a good choice, but you may need to contact them for full API access.

- **Mapaprop + Zonaprop**: Best for the Latin American market if you want detailed and real-time property listings.

- **Zillow**: The go-to for U.S. and Canadian real estate listings, especially if you need property valuation tools (Zestimate) and market trends.

- **Properium**: Ideal if you're focused on European markets, with in-depth real estate listings and property valuation.
